# README.md
Sometimes referred to as a manager "user manual", a README is intended to explicitly set expectations you can have of me as your manager. It is also a living document, which I'll update from time to time as I grow in this role. If you have questions about any of the content below, let's talk. I'd love for this to be a conversation starter.
